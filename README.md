# Equidistant Temperer
A quick and dirty script to temper intervals together or to be equidistant from one another.

Feel free to use this for any purposes (although it probably won't be much use for some!), modify it, redistribute it, do whatever you want. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. (For anyone who cares, it's under the 0BSD licence, which is basically legalese for that.)
